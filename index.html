      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to provide low‚Äëcost alternative solutions to defending critical infrastructure by leveraging both the veteran and civilian community. Put simply: we give critical infrastructure and defense partners a practical, affordable way to protect the systems that matter most.</p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúWe have done so much, for so long, with so little, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.‚Äù<br>

      </blockquote>
      <p>This isn‚Äôt about buzzwords or bloated security stacks. EVR:RDY applies the same grit, discipline, and resourcefulness forged in uniform and brings it to cyber defense.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Critical infrastructure and defense networks are facing unprecedented threats. Yet, three challenges make it nearly impossible for small utilities, municipalities, and DoD‚Äëcritical infrastructure organizations to defend themselves:</p>
      <p><strong>Underfunding:</strong> Most organizations allocate only 0‚Äì10% of their security budgets to ICS/OT, leaving critical areas under‚Äëresourced. Even as global OT security spending is projected to double by 2030, smaller entities remain priced out.</p>
      <p><strong>High Cost of Solutions:</strong> Leading OT/ICS cybersecurity platforms often start in the six‚Äëto‚Äëseven figure range, with ongoing licensing, integration, and maintenance fees that smaller utilities cannot sustain.</p>
      <p><strong>Workforce Shortage:</strong> The U.S. faces a cybersecurity workforce gap of 500,000+ unfilled jobs, while 67% of organizations report shortages and 58% say the gap puts them at significant risk.</p>

      <h2>Our Projects</h2>
      <p><strong>T.A.P.S. (Telemetry Acquisition Platform Solution)</strong><br>
      The first major initiative of EVR:RDY. T.A.P.S. is a suite of open‚Äësource tools being developed to create low‚Äëcost, practical solutions that move critical telemetry from the OT environment into the IT environment for safe ingestion into a SIEM. All T.A.P.S. components are currently under development and will be openly available on our GitHub as they mature.</p>

      <div class="indent">
        <p><strong>SEER Sensor (Scalable Endpoint & Environmental Reconnaissance)</strong><br>
        Currently in Proof of Concept (POC). SEER provides low‚Äëcost visibility for OT/ICS and IT networks by capturing mirrored traffic, generating Zeek‚Äëstyle logs, ingesting JSON from endpoints, and storing forensic data locally.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Smaller utilities and DoD‚Äëcritical infrastructure sites gain OT visibility without enterprise‚Äëlevel licensing costs.<br>
        üîó SEER Sensor Repository</p>

        <p><strong>GHOST Node / Diode</strong><br>
        Currently in Proof of Concept (POC). A hardware‚Äëenforced data diode for unidirectional UDP flow, built from inexpensive media converters, switches, and fiber.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Provides a physical security guarantee that data flows only one way ‚Äî safeguarding OT environments while enabling centralized monitoring.<br>
        üîó GHOST Node Repository</p>

        <p><strong>RAMPART (Resilient Architecture for Monitoring & Proactive Advanced Response Teams)</strong><br>
        Currently in active development. RAMPART bridges the GHOST Diode and the SIEM of choice (currently Google Chronicle). Packages data for SIEM and allows remote PCAP analysis from SEER without breaking OT isolation.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Ensures telemetry can be safely centralized, normalized, and analyzed for proactive monitoring and forensics.<br>
        üîó RAMPART Repository</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>TacSOC (Tactical Security Operations Center)</strong><br>
      A service offering currently in development. Built on top of T.A.P.S., TacSOC reimagines the SOC with a tactical mindset ‚Äî lean, efficient, and mission‚Äëfocused. Its doctrine and methodology, including the RAID framework, will remain publicly available.</p>

      <div class="indent">
        <p><strong>Smarter Defense Through AI Integration</strong><br>
        Uses advanced AI models to deduplicate and enrich telemetry, map events to MITRE ATT&CK, and automatically dismiss noise.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Analysts focus on true threats, enabling faster detection and resilient defenses.</p>

        <p><strong>Resource Pooling for Affordability</strong><br>
        Leverages cloud‚Äënative SIEMs ‚Äî currently Google Chronicle ‚Äî to enable license sharing across customers.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Provides enterprise‚Äëgrade monitoring without enterprise‚Äëgrade costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Hunter‚ÄëKiller Teams</strong><br>
        Small, skilled groups blending Tier‚Äë2 and Tier‚Äë3 analysts under a Team Leader. Tier‚Äë1 triage automated, accelerating progression and scaling defense to many sites.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Accelerates talent growth and creates a force‚Äëmultiplying defense structure.</p>

        <p><strong>RAID Methodology (Reconnaissance ¬∑ Acquire ¬∑ Investigate ¬∑ Disrupt/Defend)</strong><br>
        <strong>R ‚Äî Reconnaissance & Advisory:</strong> Establish visibility, analyze flows, identify choke points, map to ATT&CK, and conduct precision hunting.<br>
        <strong>A ‚Äî Acquire:</strong> Deploy sensors, implement one‚Äëway flows, and close visibility gaps.<br>
        <strong>I ‚Äî Investigate:</strong> AI‚Äëassisted Tier‚Äë2/3 hunts; enrich, deduplicate, and map to ATT&CK.<br>
        <strong>D ‚Äî Disrupt / Defend:</strong> Contain, remediate, harden, automate repeatable responses, and document improvements.<br>
        <em>Why it matters:</em> Enables small, distributed teams to operate with autonomy and accountability without massive centralized SOCs.</p>

      <h2>How Our Projects Solve the Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>Underfunding:</strong> T.A.P.S. provides open‚Äësource tools for enterprise‚Äëgrade visibility. TacSOC pools customers, leveraging Chronicle to share licenses and undercut costs.</p>
      <p><strong>High Cost of Solutions:</strong> GHOST and RAMPART replace expensive OT appliances with affordable, commodity‚Äëbased alternatives.</p>
      <p><strong>Workforce Shortage:</strong> TacSOC automates Tier‚Äë1, accelerates analysts from Tier‚Äë2 to Tier‚Äë3, and spins up new HK Teams ‚Äî multiplying skilled defenders faster than traditional pipelines.</p>

      <h2>Our Structure</h2>
      <p>EVR:RDY is built on a dual‚Äëtrack model ‚Äî one nonprofit, one service arm ‚Äî working together to solve the toughest challenges in critical infrastructure defense.</p>
      <p><strong>Nonprofit Arm:</strong> Pursues grants, partnerships, and collaborations to fund open‚Äësource development and training pipelines for veterans and civilians.</p>
      <p><strong>For‚ÄëProfit Arm:</strong> Delivers TacSOC and vendor support. Revenue fuels safeguarding more networks and enables higher pay with employee equity ‚Äî an ‚Äúeveryone eats‚Äù ethos.</p>
      <p><em>The vision:</em> Mission and market reinforce each other ‚Äî open collaboration drives innovation while sustainable services scale protection.</p>
