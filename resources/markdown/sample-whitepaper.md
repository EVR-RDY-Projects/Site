# EVR:RDY Cybersecurity Framework

## Executive Summary

EVR:RDY's innovative approach to cybersecurity combines veteran expertise with cutting-edge technology to deliver affordable, scalable solutions for critical infrastructure protection.

## The Challenge

Traditional cybersecurity solutions for operational technology (OT) environments face three critical limitations:

1. **High Cost Barriers** - Enterprise-grade OT security platforms often require six-to-seven figure investments
2. **Workforce Shortages** - The cybersecurity talent gap exceeds 500,000 unfilled positions
3. **Underfunding** - Most organizations allocate only 0-10% of security budgets to ICS/OT protection

## Our Solution: The R.A.I.D. Framework

### Recon

Define adversary-driven visibility by analyzing defended networks against threat intelligence and known adversary TTPs.

### Acquire

Deploy Drop VMs and passive taps at OT choke points to close visibility gaps without disrupting operations.

### Interpret

AI triage enriches, deduplicates, and maps events to MITRE ATT&CK, automatically clearing low-fidelity alerts.

### Defend

Deliver mission-ready defense packages with containment, OT hardening, and clear reporting.

## Key Technologies

### T.A.P.S. (Telemetry Acquisition Platform Solution)

- **SEER Sensor**: Scalable endpoint and environmental reconnaissance
- **GHOST Node**: Hardware-enforced data diode for unidirectional flow
- **RAMPART**: Resilient architecture for monitoring and proactive response

### TacSOC (Tactical Security Operations Center)

- AI-powered threat triage and analysis
- Resource pooling through cloud-native SIEMs
- Hunter/Killer team structure for scalable operations

## Benefits

- **Cost Reduction**: 60-80% lower than traditional enterprise solutions
- **Faster Deployment**: Weeks instead of months
- **Scalable Operations**: Hunter/Killer teams can be rapidly deployed
- **Veteran Expertise**: Battle-tested methodologies applied to cyber defense

## Conclusion

EVR:RDY's approach represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity, making enterprise-grade protection accessible to organizations of all sizes while addressing the critical talent shortage through innovative team structures and AI augmentation.
