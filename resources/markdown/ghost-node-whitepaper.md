# GHOST Node: Hardware-Enforced Data Diode

## Executive Summary

The GHOST Node represents a breakthrough in Operational Technology (OT) security, providing hardware-enforced unidirectional data flow that ensures critical infrastructure remains protected while enabling essential monitoring and analysis capabilities.

## The Challenge

Traditional network security approaches rely on software-based firewalls and access controls, which can be compromised or bypassed. In OT environments, where safety and reliability are paramount, any potential security vulnerability could have catastrophic consequences.

### Key Problems Addressed
