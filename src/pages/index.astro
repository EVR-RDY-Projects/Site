          <p>
            EVR:RDY applies the structure and precision of military cyber operations to defend the civilian systems that keep our nation running. Our approach is guided by transparency, scalability, and shared strength — principles that allow small operators to achieve large-scale resilience. We combine the openness of community-driven innovation with the power of enterprise-class automation to create a defense ecosystem that is both sustainable and effective.

            <article class="approach-card">
              <h3>Why Open Source</h3>
              <p class="badge-row">Accessibility · Transparency · Trust</p>
              <p>
                Security should never be a luxury. Open-source technology allows EVR:RDY to deliver enterprise-grade defense capabilities at a fraction of traditional cost, while maintaining the transparency and verifiability that critical infrastructure demands.
              </p>
              <p>By releasing core components of our systems and tools openly, we:</p>
              <ul class="approach-bullets">
                <li><strong>Remove barriers to adoption:</strong> Giving smaller utilities, municipalities, and operators immediate access to proven, reliable cybersecurity technology without vendor lock-in.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable collective innovation:</strong> Empowering a global community of defenders, researchers, and veterans to continuously enhance the tools protecting our shared infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure auditability and safety:</strong> Allowing operators to inspect every line of code that touches their environment, building confidence that no hidden risks exist.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustain long-term resilience:</strong> Ensuring that open ecosystems endure beyond vendor lifecycles or budget cycles, providing continuity in protection.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="approach-note">Open source is not a business model — it is a mission principle. It keeps innovation accessible, defenses transparent, and security sustainable, especially for those protecting systems vital to national stability.</p>

              <h3>Why Google SecOps</h3>
              <p class="badge-row">Scale · Automation · Collective Defense</p>
              <p>
                The TACSOC (Threat Analysis &amp; Cyber Security Operations Center) operates on Google SecOps (Chronicle) because it delivers nation-scale analytics at mission-level affordability. Built for massive telemetry, Chronicle provides the performance, automation, and reach required to defend multiple infrastructure sites under one unified command.
              </p>
              <p>We chose Google SecOps because it enables:</p>
              <ul class="approach-bullets">
                <li><strong>Massive Scalability:</strong> Ingests telemetry from hundreds of distributed OT/ICS environments without on-premise overhead.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Driven Speed:</strong> Integrated Gemini AI accelerates triage, detection, and response, amplifying the impact of small elite teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Unified Data Model (UDM):</strong> Normalizes telemetry from T.A.P.S. and other data sources for rapid enrichment and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared Intelligence:</strong> Threat detections and insights from one defended site immediately strengthen all others, forming a collective defense network.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational Affordability:</strong> Shared licensing and cloud-native infrastructure reduce per-operator cost while expanding analytical reach.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Funding Plan</h3>
              <p class="badge-row">Sustainable Growth · Mission Reinvestment</p>
              <p>
                EVR:RDY’s funding model is designed to sustain operations without compromising mission integrity. Every dollar supports capability growth, workforce development, and defensive readiness for the operators who need it most.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our financial approach blends traditional and community-driven funding streams to create enduring independence and resilience:
              </p>
              <ul class="approach-bullets">
                <li><strong>Subscription-Based Services:</strong> TACSOC and managed defense offerings are provided through scalable, pooled subscriptions that minimize per-operator cost while maintaining enterprise-grade capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Public–Private Partnerships:</strong> Collaborations with state, municipal, and federal stakeholders align national security priorities with local operational needs, funding deployments that protect shared infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Mission-Aligned Investment:</strong> Private and veteran-led capital supports expansion of open-source development, training programs, and AI-driven operational tools — ensuring profits reinforce purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Grant and Cooperative Programs:</strong> Federal and state cybersecurity grants are leveraged to subsidize rural and small-utility deployments, accelerating equitable access to modern defense technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Reinvestment:</strong> A portion of net proceeds is reinvested directly into R&amp;D, training, and the veteran workforce pipeline to continuously improve capabilities and expand reach.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="approach-note">This model ensures EVR:RDY remains self-sustaining, mission-driven, and community-empowering — not dependent on single-source funding or external control. It aligns with our founding principle: to defend forward, affordably, and for all.</p>
            </article>
          </div>

          <h3>In Combination</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Open Source</strong> provides the foundation — a transparent, accessible layer of telemetry and tooling any operator can deploy safely.<br />
            <strong>Google SecOps</strong> provides the command layer — an AI-accelerated analysis and response engine that turns distributed telemetry into coordinated action.
          </p>
          <p>Together, they embody EVR:RDY’s operational doctrine:</p>
          <blockquote class="mission-quote">
            <p>“Open where possible, automated where practical, and secure by design everywhere.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This integration allows the TACSOC to deliver enterprise-class detection, investigation, and response for small and midsized critical infrastructure operators — at a cost, scale, and speed they can truly sustain.

            <h2>Data Flow</h2>
            <p>
              T.A.P.S. (Telemetry, Analysis, Processing, and Security) is the backbone of our defensive operations — a disciplined data pipeline that carries mission-critical telemetry from the farthest edge of the OT network directly into analysts’ hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pipeline ensures that every packet, signal, and alert moves securely, transparently, and with measurable impact. From remote field sensors to central command dashboards, T.A.P.S. provides the real-time visibility that defenders need to anticipate, identify, and neutralize threats before they disrupt operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              From SCOUT at the host to the TacSOC, every component is engineered to keep defenders ahead of threats without vendor lock-in.
